HW1 for COSC 4370 

I used CLion as my IDE. I ran my code on ubuntu using ./a.out 300 

For my renderPixel function I altered X and Y with size to transform the pixels accordingly. I also added another parameter to the function (“Radius”) this was so the program could distinguish between the circle of R 150 or R 100. This allowed the program to draw the semi circles in the correct quadrants. 

For my raterizeArc function I used the midpoint formula from the reading provided to us. I modified a few things that being the X and the Y variable. I had to offset X and set X to 150 to change the center. I added X to Y = radius to adjust for the re-centering done to X.
